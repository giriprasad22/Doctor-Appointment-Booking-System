# Doctor-Appointment-Booking-System
🩺 Doctor Appointment Booking System
Your health, your schedule – made simple.
A clean and interactive frontend project to simplify doctor appointments online.

📌 Project Overview
This Doctor Appointment Web App allows three types of users — Patients, Doctors, and Admins — to interact through a clean, intuitive web interface. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this frontend-only system simulates login portals, registration forms, and user dashboards for each role.
